# New Version!

Now using different methods // MUCH EFFICIENT

Supported methods
- Python inbuilt variables
- Numpy array
- Vectorize GPU
- Vectorize parallel (CPU)
- JIT CPU
- JIT CUDA


# Old version below

Made using PyGame so you could run directly or open Python IDE and run.

Basic usage instruction:

- Click to add object.
- Drag to add object with velocity.
- Once clicked or dragged you could set mass and size my moving cursor, once at desirable value click to push into simulatin iteration.
- Use arrows to move camera.
- R key would reset the simulator.
- PPS(Physics per second) shows how many times the calculation are done in a second.
- Use Z and X while setting mass/size to change the apperance of the object(This won't affect physically).
