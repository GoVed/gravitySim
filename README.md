# gravitySim
2D gravity simulator

# New Version!

Now using different methods // MUCH EFFICIENT

Supported methods
- Python inbuilt variables
- Numpy array
- Vectorize GPU
- Vectorize parallel (CPU)
- JIT CPU
- JIT CUDA


# Old version below

Made using PyGame so you could run directly or open Python IDE and run.

Basic usage instruction:

-Click to add object.

-Drag to add object with velocity.

-Once clicked or dragged you could set mass and size my moving cursor, once at desirable value click to push into simulatin iteration.

-Use arrows to move camera.

-R key would reset the simulator.

-PPS(Physics per second) shows how many times the calculation are done in a second.

-Use Z and X while setting mass/size to change the apperance of the object(This won't affect physically).
